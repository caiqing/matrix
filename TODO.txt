TODO:

Revisit rain logic
  Rework columns to support multiple drops at once
    Switch to some kind of continuous noise source
        And remember, cycling needs to be continuous too
    Give each glyph an XY for its four vertices, which doesn't change



Reach out to Ashley's partner about producing sounds


Much later:
  Dissolve threejs project into webgl project
    Maybe webgl2 project?

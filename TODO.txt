TODO:

Revisit rain logic
  Rework columns to support multiple drops at once
    Switch to some kind of continuous noise source
        Remember, cycling needs to be continuous too (but then mod 1)
        Vertex shader uses continuous function to derive UV and brightness
    Static mesh: Give each vertex of a glyph the same XY, different vec2 corners



Reach out to Ashley's partner about producing sounds


Much later:
  Optimization: calculate texture derivatives on CPU, pass in as a uniform
  Optimization: simpler bloom replacement
  Dissolve threejs project into webgl project
    Maybe webgl2 project?
  Flashing row effect?
